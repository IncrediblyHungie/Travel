### 📊 Progressive Schedule
```

```

### 🛡️ Safety Features Added
- **Timezone normalization**: Uses UTC noon for consistent behavior
- **Boundary checks**: Never shows more destinations than available

1. **Disable progressive reveal**: Set `ENABLE_LIMITED_VIEW = false` in Netlify
2. **Add test date**: Set `TEST_DATE_OVERRIDE` in Netlify environment
3. **Increase destinations**: Adjust `DAYS_TO_SHOW` in Netlify environment
